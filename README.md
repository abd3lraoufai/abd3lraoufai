## ✨ About Me

I'm a **Senior Android Developer** with **7+ years** of experience crafting high-quality mobile applications. My journey in Android development has led me to specialize in **Jetpack Compose** (which I've been working with for over **3 years**), implementing **Clean Architecture**, and practicing **Test-Driven Development**. 

I'm passionate about building efficient, maintainable, and user-friendly mobile experiences that deliver real value to users. My approach combines technical excellence with a deep understanding of user needs to create applications that are both powerful and intuitive.

## 🚀 Professional Journey

At **[Storyteller](https://www.getstoryteller.com/)** (Apr 2022 - Feb 2025), I've grown as a **Senior Android Developer** working on SDK development and integration for major clients. My role encompasses *architecture design*, *Jetpack Compose implementation*, and *team leadership*. I've been instrumental in modernizing the codebase, integrating advertising solutions, and building a React Native wrapper for our SDK.

During my time at **[Vodafone Egypt](http://vf.eg/anavodafone)** (May 2021 - Mar 2022), I focused on *application architecture* and implementing *TDD & BDD methodologies*. My work involved security analysis, building robust *CI/CD pipelines*, and ensuring comprehensive test coverage for critical app features used by millions of users.

As an **Android Developer** on **Upwork** (Apr 2019 - Mar 2021), I delivered custom solutions built with *Clean Architecture* principles. I crafted polished user interfaces, implemented efficient *caching mechanisms*, and set up reliable *CI/CD integrations* to ensure smooth deployment processes.
